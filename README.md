# filamentStorageDatabase
This system stores information about all of your 3D printing spools!

## The Problem
Have a bunch of extra spools laying around your shop for your 3D printer? Do you even know how much material is left on half of them? How about the date you received the spool? This repo will solve all of your problems.

## Solution
With a windows client GUI and google sheets interfacing for storage, you can upload and keep track of all of your 3D printing spools with filamentStorageDatabase. 

## Registering a spool
To register a spool is easy:
1. In the "New" tab, fill out information regarding your spool and print out the QR code generated by the software
2. Place the QR code on your spool, which contains your spool's new ID. 
That's it!

## Updating a spool's data:
1. Scan the spool with your computer's camera and wait for the information to populate
2. Update any fields as necessary and save the data to Google Drive
