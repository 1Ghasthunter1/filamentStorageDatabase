# filamentStorageDatabase
python scripts and GUI that store information about filament spools

Works by using a google sheets doc to store all of the info

I've removed the credentials.json for obvious reasons as well from github

Also, make sure you have venv installed to run this virtual environment, preferrably with a newer version of python 3. All of the packages are included in the venv folder. To activate, navigate to /vsEnvironment1/Scripts and run activate.bat 

You will also need to use google API and incorporate it with sheets, something that I'm too tired to type right now because I did this all of today.
